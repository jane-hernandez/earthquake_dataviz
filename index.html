      <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="color: black;">
            Our project is aimed at exploring the fascinating world of seismic activity around the world. We are all familiar with
            earthquakes, tsunamis and other ground shakingly humbling events that occur on our planet. But have you ever looked into the
            data about how often, or devistating these events can be? If not, we hope that you will find our project interesting.
          </p>

        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="color: black;">
            We decided to obtain our data from EveryEarthquake API (https://rapidapi.com/dbarkman/api/everyearthquake). Our
            initial data scraping provided 1,000 observations of earthquake type events but we will pull more data of the other types
            of seismic events for a more comprehensive analysis. The dataset obtained contains the following columns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Index: An index assigned to each observation in the dataset.</li>
            <li>Id: A combination of a 2-letter Seismic Network Code and a number assigned by the contributing seismic network.</li>
            <li>Magnitude: The magnitude of the vibrations based on the Richter scale.</li>
            <li>Type: The classification of the event based on its intensity. In our case, we only took earthquake-type rows.</li>
            <li>Title: It indicates the event's name based on the origin's magnitude and location.</li>
            <li>Date: It reports the date and time of the event. The timezone of reference for the time is not indicated.</li>
            <li>Time: Time of origin of the earthquake using an UTC to avoid confusion caused by local time zones.</li>
            <li>Updated: Time when the event was most recently updated.</li>
            <li>Url: Link to USGS Event Page for event.</li>
            <li>detailUrl: Link to the webpage with the details about the event.</li>
            <li>Felt: This indicates the number of people who reported feeling the earthquake. This information may be absent from many rows because it is website-source specific.</li>
            <li>Cdi: Stands for Community Decimal Intensity and is the result of assigning a single intensity to each community of people who reported an earthquake.</li>
            <li>Mmi: It measures the damage level of the earthquake on the surface, and it’s a measure that goes from 0 to 12.</li>
            <li>Alert: The alert level from the PAGER earthquake impact scale.</li>
            <li>Status: Indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human.</li>
            <li>Tsunami: If the flag value is "1", the event will include a link to the NOAA Tsunami website for tsunami information.</li>
            <li>Sig: A number describing how significant the event is. Determined on a number of factors, including: magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated impact.</li>
            <li>Net: The ID of a data contributor. Identifies the network considered to be the preferred source of information for this event.</li>
            <li>Code: An identifying code assigned by - and unique from - the corresponding source for the event.</li>
            <li>Ids: A comma-separated list of event ids that are associated to an event.</li>
            <li>Sources: Could be the website that provided the data.</li>
            <li>Types: Type of seismic event.</li>
            <li>Nst: Total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location.</li>
            <li>Dmin: Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (in degrees).</li>
            <li>Rms: Root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights.</li>
            <li>Gap: Largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees).</li>
            <li>Magtype: Method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event.</li>
            <li>Geometrytype: Geometry type of the distribution of the earthquake.</li>
            <li>Depth: Depth of the event in kilometers, Hypocentral depth.</li>
            <li>Latitude: Decimal degrees latitude. Negative values for southern latitudes. Range is [-90.0,90.0].</li>
            <li>Longitude: Decimal degrees longitude. Negative values for western longitudes. [-180.0,180.0].</li>
            <li>Place — textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name, with additional distance measured in km.</li>
            <li>distanceKM — distance measured in km of the earthquake.</li>
            <li>placeOnly — Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name.</li>
            <li>Location — network that originally authored the reported location of this event.</li>
            <li>Continent — Continent where the event occurred.</li>
            <li>Country — country where the event occurred (i.e. USA).</li>
            <li>Subnational — Subnation where the event occurred (i.e. Alaska, Oregon…)</li>
            <li>City — City where the event occurred.</li>
            <li>Locality — Area or district where the event occurred.</li>
            <li>Postcode — Postcode of the area affected by the earthquake.</li>
            <li>What3words — Random 3 words associated with each event.</li>

        <h2>Task analysis</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="color: black;">
            We aimed to split the project into three primary tasks. Namely:
            <li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
            <li>Static graphic design</li>
            <li>Dynamic graphic design</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            The first point looks into the data set to ensure that there is enough useful data and no repeated data for this project.
            This was to ensure that the data we display is of good quality and that the subject matter is objectively viable and useful.
            This process also included deriving new colums- namely the continent column from the the geolocations of the earthquakes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The and third points aimed to generate useful and detailed graphics that the user of our website can enjoy and interact with.
            Please do note that due the fact that the interactive apps are being hosted on a free server at the moment, the interactions may lag 
            a little bit. The lag can be avoided if you decide to run the code form the git hub repository connected to this webpage. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The final step of the project entailed creating some web pages to host our findings. This is the page you are corrently reading through. 
            To display the interactive graphs on this webpage, the apps were uploaded and hosted on render and the pages were shown here using the .html
            'iframe' functionality. So without any further ado, please click on any of the links below to be redirected to our images and Enjoy!
