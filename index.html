      <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="color: black;">
            Our project is aimed at exploring the fascinating world of seismic activity around the world. We are all familiar with
            earthquakes, tsunamis and other ground shakingly humbling events that occur on our planet. But have you ever looked into the
            data about how often, or devistating these events can be? If not, we hope that you will find our project interesting.

        <h3>Dataset</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="color: black;">
            The data set that we have analyses for this tast comes from rapid API, which is a free online API sharing site with a plethora of 
            API's to choose from for projects just linke these. The data set contains:
          </p>
        </div>
      
        <h4>Dataset</h4>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="color: black;">
            We aimed to split the project into three primary tasks. Namely:
            <li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
            <li>Static graphic design</li>
            <li>Dynamic graphic design</li>
            The first point looks into the data set to ensure that there is enough useful data and no repeated data for this project.
            This was to ensure that the data we display is of good quality and that the subject matter is objectively viable and useful.
            This process also included deriving new colums- namely the continent column from the the geolocations of the earthquakes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The and third points aimed to generate useful and detailed graphics that the user of our website can enjoy and interact with.
            Please do note that due the fact that the interactive apps are being hosted on a free server at the moment, the interactions may lag 
            a little bit. The lag can be avoided if you decide to run the code form the git hub repository connected to this webpage. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The final step of the project entailed creating some web pages to host our findings. This is the page you are corrently reading through. 
            To display the interactive graphs on this webpage, the apps were uploaded and hosted on render and the pages were shown here using the .html
            'iframe' functionality. So without any further ado, please click on any of the links below to be redirected to our images and Enjoy!
