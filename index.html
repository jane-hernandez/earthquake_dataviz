            The below graph shows the relationship between the MMI of the earthquake and the Magnitude of the earthquake.
            Along the top and right axes, the distributions of the fucntions are shown and the colour coordination here informs you about wether or not a
            tsunami resulted from the event. What we found interesting is that there were some earthquakes that measured as high as 7 and above that did not 
            produce a tsunami and produced minimal mmi or surface damage. This implies that although the earthquake did not originate on land, it did not produce a tsunami.
            This may be the result of the eartquake originating deep below the ocean's surface. We found this very cool and thought more investigation should follow.

            The second of our static graphs shows the relationship between the depth below the earth's core and the number of seismic stations that are posted. 
            Here we see that there are a numer of stations that are posted at over 600 kilometers deep! Given that it is widely considered dangerous for a scuba diver to 
            go beyond 25 meters for a multitude of reasons, we found this incredible! The data that we have, unfortunately does have
